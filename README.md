# Submission

This is my submission for the Air Quality coding task.

## Instructions

Please navigate into the dist folder using node. Then simply run 'node app.js', and open a browser to 'localhost:3000'.

## Statement

This has been tested and should work on all modern browsers. Unfortunately the main packages used (such as the interactive map) do not work on IE11, however the main functionality is still present in the city selector so I hope this is acceptable.

I have included a seeds folder outside the 'dist' submission, this is simply a script I used to create geodata for the given locations to place on the map. It is not strictly necessary for the submission, hence why it is not included in the 'dist' directory, however I have added it in case it is of interest for review.

Many thanks for the opportunity, I look forward to hearing from you soon!
